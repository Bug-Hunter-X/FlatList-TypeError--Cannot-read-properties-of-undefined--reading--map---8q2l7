# React Native FlatList TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using FlatList in React Native and provides a solution to handle inconsistent data structures.

## Problem

When the FlatList component receives data with inconsistencies, such as undefined values or objects lacking expected properties, it can throw a TypeError.  This often presents as "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" because the FlatList attempts to map over an undefined or improperly structured data source.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully validating and handling the data source before rendering it within the FlatList.  This includes checking for null or undefined values and ensuring that each item in the array has the expected properties.
